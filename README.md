# 4STAR_codes
Collection of Matlab codes used for routine and special analysis of 4STAR measurements analysis.
- Includes codes for combining raw 4STAR files (allstarmat)
- Includes codes for direct beam aerosol optical thickness calculations (starsun)
- Includes codes for zenith radiance calculations (starzen)
- Includes codes for sky scans, almucantar and principal plane (starsky)

Combination of codes to run 4STAR data analysis from NASA Ames Research Center


This code repository is mainly used for internal development of 4STAR analysis codes for the Sun-sat research team. 


The codes contained herein are for science analysis. The very nature of this research promotes evolving programs, thus legacy codes may still be prominent, with some lack in documentation. This code is published online in the spirit of the the Community Research and Academic Programming License. http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~pat/extremal/distribution/CRAPL-LICENSE.txt
